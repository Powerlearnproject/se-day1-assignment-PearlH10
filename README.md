Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintenace of high quality software system.
It is important as it creates software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life,communication and health care and others.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developing of the programming language such as python,javascripts and C#

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Implememntation-Writing code and building the software accordingg to the design specification.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall it is an approach with distinct phases example requirements ,implementation and design.
Agile is lterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and t=responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsile for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager oversees the planning , excecution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writting,debugging and testing code example Visual studio.
VCS is a sofwtare tools for tracking chnages to source code and coordinating work among team members examples Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, they can overcome this by extending the time to the project as this will delay the deadline.
Tight dealines, they can overcome this by working as a team and flexibilty hours.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Uni testing - testing indivitual components or modules of software.
Intergration testing - testing interactions between differents components.
Sytemn testing - testing the entire software sytem.
Acceptance testing - testing the software against usr requirements to enusre it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction in order to produce the best possible outcome from generative airtifial intelligence model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Tell me something about Artifial intelligence.
Improved prompt - Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning in AI.
The improved prompt is more effective because AI can delievr responses that are more clear and precise.
